# quandary

> **quandary** (noun _plural_ quandaries): a state of perplexity or uncertainty over what to do in a difficult situation.

## Prologue

  > _"As technology—especially computer, information, and Internet technology—permeates all aspects of our society,
  > people who understand that technology need to be part of public-policy discussions.
  > **We need technologists who work in the public interest**.
  > We need public-interest technologists."_
  > [Bruce Schneier](https://public-interest-tech.com/)

  > "The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, **it is what is already here**,
  > the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it.
  > The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.
  > The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: **seek and learn to recognize who and what,**
  > **in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space**."
  > 
  > Italo Calvino, _Invisible Cities_

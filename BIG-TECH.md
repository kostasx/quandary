  > _"A gig economy is characterized by temporary, contract, and freelance jobs rather than permanent positions. Gig workers enjoy flexibility but often lack job security and essential benefits such as health insurance. Employers benefit by saving costs and hiring from a larger, globally accessible talent pool. Potential downsides include disrupted work-life balance, financial insecurity for workers, and limited career development."_

## TERMINOLOGY

  - **Gig Economy**: _"The gig economy, also known as the sharing or access economy, features temporary, freelance, and part-time positions often filled by independent contractors. While offering flexibility and independence to workers, it removes job security and benefits like health insurance and paid leave. Companies save costs by hiring freelancers without these benefits."_ [Source: Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gig-economy.asp)
